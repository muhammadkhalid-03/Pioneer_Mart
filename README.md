## Project Description

We plan to build a mobile application that provides a campus-based online platform for buying and selling second-hand products, as well as requesting and providing services, within the Grinnell community. With this app, Grinnellians will be able to easily exchange second-hand products and services, such as textbooks, dorm supplies, transportation, and haircuts. The target users of the app will be the Grinnell College community.

Notable competitors include Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, and Poshmark. Etsy is an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell handmade items with an emphasis on arts & crafts. Poshmark is also an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell clothing, home goods, beauty products and more. While platforms like Etsy and Poshmark serve as notable competitors, our app differentiates itself by being exclusively accessible to individuals with a Grinnell College email address. This ensures a secure, college-focused marketplace tailored specifically to the needs of Grinnellians. The common user will be Grinnell College students, faculty, and staff.

For the backend and frontend folders, the main packages and tools to run the packages are included. The backend folder contains all the Django frameworks with the required `manage.py` to run the framework. Python dependencies are managed via `uv` and `pyproject.toml`. For the frontend, there are React Native frameworks with npm/yarn and `package.json`.

## Sprint Reports

The sprint reports can be found in the "sprint_reports" folder along with the milestone reports.

Sprint 01 planning (named sprint_01_planning.md) can be found in the link in markdown file in the sprint_reports folder.

Sprint 01 outcomes (named sprint_01_outcomes.md) can be found in the link in the markdown file in the sprint_reports folder.

Sprint 02 planning (named sprint_02_planning.md) can be found in the link in markdown file in the sprint_reports folder.

Sprint 02 outcomes (named sprint_02.md) can be found in the link in markdown file in the sprint_reports folder.

## Installing modules

### Installing Frontend Dependencies

> \> cd src/frontend

> \> npm install

### Installing Backend Dependencies

> \> cd src/backend

> \> uv sync

## Testing

We are using pytest, flake8, and mypy in order to test our back-end code. For the front end, we are using Jest, React Testing Library, and human-driven testing. The git actions are set up in the repository.

### How to run the tests?

Backend (Django related)
Pre-requisite: be in the src/backend folder and sync dependencies with uv.

> \> uv run python3 manage.py migrate

> \> uv run python3 manage.py test

Frontend
Pre-requisite: be in the src/frontend folder and install all the requirements from package.json. Also requires react native in one's environment.

> \> export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

> \> yarn jest

## Running the Application

Pre-requisites:

- XCode must be installed on Macbooks for simulations. Otherwise, Expo Go must be installed on either an iOS or Android (for iOS and Android, separate environmental variables are required and some code segments must be changed such as the allowed hosts).
- The root directory must be within src, and depending on backend or frontend (there must also be 2 separate terminals to run the application)
- npm must be installed. For more details about installing NPM, please refer to this [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Running the Backend (server)

From the **repository root**, the quickest path is:

> \> make dev

This runs the backend with one command by:

- syncing backend dependencies with `uv`
- applying Django migrations
- starting the local development server

If your development Postgres is local, set `HOST=localhost` in `src/backend/.env`.

**Run the backend manually** (equivalent pieces, from `src/backend`):

> \> uv sync --group dev  
> \> uv run python manage.py migrate  
> \> uv run python manage.py runserver

Configure database, email, `SECRET_KEY`, and other settings via `src/backend/.env` (see `src/backend/core/settings.py` / `backend/settings` for loaded variables). For SQLite-only local use, some teams set `USE_SQLITE` or rely on development defaults per your project’s `.env` template.

Running the Frontend (npm)

> \> npm install

> \> npx expo start

### EAS builds and store submit (production)

Run these from **`src/frontend`** with the [EAS CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) logged in (`eas login`) and project configured (`eas.json`). Set production environment variables (for example `BASE_URL`, `IOS_APP_STORE_URL`) in the Expo dashboard or build profile so `app.config.js` picks them up at build time.

**iOS — production binary:**

> \> eas build --profile production --platform ios

**iOS — submit to App Store Connect** (after a successful build):

> \> eas submit --platform ios

**Android — internal / preview distribution** (uses the `preview` profile from `eas.json`, not `production`):

> \> eas build --profile preview --platform android

**Wiping Production Data**

> \> uv --directory src/backend run python manage.py wipe_data --settings backend.settings.production

## Operational Use Cases

Use Case 1, 3 are very doable right now with the current prototype that we have. For the other user cases, we have the backend framework constructed, but requires bridging with the frontend in order to actually be used. Some alternative flows such as contacting the other user or selecting the categories are some of the specific features that we are working on.

## Issue Managements

All the issues will be managed in Trello.com. [Link to Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HqVxVWt0/pioneer-mart)

## Additional Alerts

For the sprints from 5 and onwards, it would be great if it was evaluated based on "dup-main" branch as it does not have any PostGres data framework.
